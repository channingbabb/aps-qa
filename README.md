# APS Quick Access

I will no longer be making updates to this project, this project didn't fulfill too many company needs.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install apsqa.

```bash
npm i
```

## Building application
I didn't put too much effort into fixing this issue, but whenever you run:
```bash
npm run build
```
It will put the compiled files into the /dist folder.  So before you run
```bash
npm run dist
```
Move the compiled files from dist to build.  The distribution package is in /dist after running that command.
